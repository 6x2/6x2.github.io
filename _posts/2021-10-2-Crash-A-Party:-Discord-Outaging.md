# Preface
As the title suggests, this post will touch on how a group of people exploited Discords gateway to cause server outage. <!--more--> <br>

On May 5, 2020 a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA-tnZ8wlbY) was made by a user named "iLinked", basically the video was a "meme" video of them exploiting Discord's gateway to cause a server outage with how to do the exploit in the description.

I will be breaking down the exploit iLinked put in the descrption on how it works for the people reading that aren't very knowledgeable with programming.
